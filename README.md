[+] Standardized on RPMReader (removed duplicate MemoryReader + consolidated fallback logic).
[+] Added logging/error handling for SendInput and memory reads (invalid offsets now warn instead of silent returns).
[+] Made process/module names configurable via Config.
[+] Optimized view-angle reads (batched pitch & yaw).
[+] Added idle timeout reset for recoil control (>2s pause).
[+] Added GUI + config toggle for mouse recording (default True).
[+] Introduced per-target aiming profiles (get_target_profile) for unique smoothing/jitter per enemy.
[+] Blended learned recoil corrections with human mouse data.
[+] Fixed learning crash/unpack issues; updated schema to (dp, dy, distance, bone, velocity).
[+] Rebuilt RecoilViewer with new schema + bone/distance/velocity stats and scatter plots.
[+] Patched AimbotRCS.run smoothing & max move (default 25, clamp before rounding).
[+] Fixed circular jitter bug (switched sin/cos jitter → small random jitter, reduced smoothing cap, added snap-to-target).
